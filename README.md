  <em>Code splitting and lazy-loading components for <a href="https://alpinejs.dev">Alpine.js</a>!</em><br><br>

Async Alpine is a wrapper around the Alpine.js JavaScript framework that allows you to load components asynchronously on-demand.

Alpine.js is a fantastic framework but with a large site with lots of components, the bundle size can start to become a performance problem!

Async Alpine allows you to split your components into multiple component files and only load them when they're needed, speeding up your first load!
